<!-- The index.html file serves as the foundational HTML shell for the Qrono application.
 It is not a typical, static webpage. Instead, it's a minimal template containing
 essential metadata and, most importantly, a single <div> element with the ID app.
 This div acts as a mounting point. The entire Vue application, after being built
 and initialized by main.js, gets injected into this div, effectively turning it
 into an interactive single-page application. -->
